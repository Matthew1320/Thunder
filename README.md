# Thunder
efg.py is my programming script for the Oklahoma City Thunder intern application. To run it, make sure you have python, numpy, and pandas downloaded and you are running the script from the same directory as shots_data.csv file. This was a super fun technical assessment and even if I do not move forward in the application process, this has been a great experience.
